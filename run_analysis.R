#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
#with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Do it slightly out of order. Label and give avtivity names 
#and then find mean and standard deviation in columns
